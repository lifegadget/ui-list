  ## Overview
  The goal of this addon is to provide highly reusable primitives for user interface elements which fall under the very common category of "list and items" user interface elements. This minimal representation will be represented by the following:

  - **`ui-item` Component** - a minimal item representation
  - **`list` Mixin** - all of the generalized list functionality
  - **`item` Mixin** - all of the generalized item functionality

  The responsibilities that will be assumed for a list _versus_ an item _versus_ a section will break down like so:
